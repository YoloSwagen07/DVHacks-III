# DVHacks-III

Welcome to our project, the Fire Tracker. We have done something similar in the past, but we have greatly changed and improved it as well as create a website for it. We are somewhat experienced coders, but have no clue how to use Github. Anyways, excuse our inconsistency in committing and publishing things. The code we made yesterday night for the arduino is here so far.
